# Classificaton of articles using NLP
MOTIVATION
Unstructured data in the form of text is everywhere: emails, chats, web pages, social media, support tickets, survey responses, and more. Text can be an extremely rich source of information, but extracting insights from it can be hard and time-consuming due to its unstructured nature. Thus our motive is to extract useful information, leaving out the unnecessary ones and turning text classification in a fast and cost-efficient way to enhance decision-making and automate processes.

PROBLEM STATEMENT
Classification of news articles (source), based on the topic of the article. We are interested in a specific set of articles like Merger and Acquisition, Self Storage Industries. This is a Multi-Class classification problem and we assume that one article pertains to one topic.

OBJECTIVE
The objective of the project includes the following:
•	The main objective of the project is to create a model that takes useful insights from given news articles. 
•	The model will be made more accurate in predictions and classifications.
•	To ensure that this model can perform well on a computer with less specifications. 
•	The final accuracy – The quality of the product should be the best in order to satisfy the customers. 
•	Correlation between the numeric data present in the data extracted.
•	Giving a clear idea upon which attributes has more weightage towards the target to be obtained.

SCOPE
Text analysis, as a whole, is an emerging field of study. Fields such as marketing, product management, academia, and governance a real ready leveraging the process of analyzing and extracting information from textual data. In layman's terms, text classification is the process of extracting generic tags from unstructured text. These generic tags come from a set of predefined categories.

OUTLINE OF THE PROJECT
We have been provided with totally 100 articles which contain sub article of same type. Either of the articles is of Merger and acquisition or Setting up a storage industry, and all the data is live data, and is not from any online repository. Hence the major task of the project is to convert the given data under some attributes of choice. Next we build models upon the such extracted data, with different algorithms. We compare scores for each Machine learning algorithm and finally suggesting the best Not only for the training data but also for new inputs given I.e, for testing data also we predict the output obtain, which may be used by the companies.
