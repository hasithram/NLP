    "Midwest Storage Development LLC plans to convert a four-story building on the northeast corner of East 30th Street and Chester Avenue in Cleveland, OH, into a self-storage operation. The Indianapolis-based company bought the building for $1.9 million from Chester 3133 Properties LLC. Robert McCormack, Midwest president, said his company will spend “several million” dollars to convert the property, which he expects to open in 2020. Extra Space Storage Inc. will operate the facility. \n",

    "The Metropolitan Development Commission in Indianapolis, IN, denied a plan to build self-storage in a former Marsh grocery store after receiving a petition with 700-plus signatures that opposed the project. The Southwest Association of Neighbors said the area has enough storage businesses, and that they want a say about what replaces the Marsh. The site is on the southwest side near Kentucky Avenue and Mann Road in Mars Hill. \n",
